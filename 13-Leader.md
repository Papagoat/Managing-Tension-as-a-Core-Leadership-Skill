Effectively navigating team tension requires a proactive and empathetic leadership approach, grounded in understanding, communication, and shared purpose.

## Tension: Recognition and Response

- **Identifying Tension Points**: Acknowledge areas of tension within the team. Understand the root causes and how they manifest in team dynamics.

## Inquiry: Cultivating a Safe Space for Questions

- **Creating a Safe Space**: Foster an environment where it's safe to express uncertainty and ask questions. This openness can lead to deeper understanding and collaboration.

- **Adopting a Learner Stance**: Model and encourage a learner mindset over a judgmental one. Emphasize the value of curiosity and open-ended questioning in uncovering new insights and solutions.

- **Skills for Inquiry**: Practice switching from judgmental to learner stances and master the art of asking empowering questions.

- **Practicing Wise Vulnerability**: Share your own challenges and uncertainties as a leader. This act can encourage others to open up, building trust and deepening connections within the team.

- **Skills for Defense**: Navigate the balance between being open and maintaining the necessary boundaries for effective leadership.

## Naming: Empowering through Language

- **Managing Value-based Tensions**: Introduce frameworks like Polarity Management to help the team navigate tensions arising from differing values, viewing them as dilemmas to be managed rather than problems with a single solution.

- **Skills for Values Exploration**: Cultivate the ability to uncover and align team values, using tension as a means to deepen understanding and collaboration.
