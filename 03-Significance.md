# The Significance of Tension in Leadership

Tension, far from being an obstacle, is a fundamental element of life and growth within any organization or team. It signals vitality, the potential for movement, relationship building, and the dynamic interplay of diverse elements within a system. A leader's ability to create and manage tension is paramount, as it directly influences the organization's capacity for innovation, adaptability, and resilience.

# Core Competencies for Leading in the Unknown

1. **Tension**:
Tension is a marker of engagement and aliveness. It fuels movement, relationships, and life itself. Leaders who understand how to manage tension can drive their teams towards innovation and growth.

2. **Inquiry**:
Asking questions is a crucial leadership skill. It reflects a commitment to the team and organization, recognizing one's limitations and the value of collective intelligence.

3. **Defend**:
Leaders have the power to choose their responses to tension. Moving from reactive impulses to reflective choices is essential for constructive engagement with challenges.

4. **Naming**:
The words leaders choose shape their reality. Effective naming frames situations in ways that open up possibilities for action and collaboration.

5. **Values**:
Values are the bedrock of decision-making. Understanding and aligning with personal and collective values is crucial for authentic leadership and motivation.

# Principles for Navigating Tension

- **Work from the Inside Out**: Start with core values and let them guide actions and decisions.
- **Prioritize Growth and Relationships**: Focus on developing people and maintaining strong relationships over mere organizational growth.
- **Recognize the Power of Words**: Words shape perceptions and realities. Use them wisely to influence positively.
- **Acknowledge the Role of Filters**: Our perceptions are filtered through personal and collective lenses. Being aware of these filters allows for more nuanced understanding and interaction.

# Managing Dilemmas vs. Problems

Understanding the distinction between dilemmas and problems is vital. While problems have solutions, dilemmas require a balance of values and perspectives, emphasizing the power of "and" over the "or." Leaders must navigate these tensions, not by seeking definitive answers but by fostering environments where diverse values can coexist and inform decision-making.

# Values and Feelings as Guides

Emotions are indicators of underlying values. By paying attention to feelings such as anger, joy, disgust, fear, and sadness, leaders can gain insights into the values at play within themselves and their teams. This emotional intelligence is key to aligning actions with core values and navigating the complexities of leadership.

# Conclusion

The ability to manage tension effectively, to engage in meaningful inquiry, to make reflective choices, to use language powerfully, and to align with core values are essential competencies for leadership in uncertain times. Leaders who master these skills can foster environments of growth, trust, and innovation, turning challenges into opportunities for development and success.
