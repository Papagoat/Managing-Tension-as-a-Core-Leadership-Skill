# Managing Tension as a Core Leadership Skill - Introduction
It is interesting to note that there is no positive word in the English language for conflict or tension. in Asia, tension and conflict are often regarded as states to be avoided - in issues, in communication, in relationships.

This view of tension is limiting and has severe consequences on the quality of learning and growth in teams, for the following reasons:
Leaders are now leading in times of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity(VUCA). Often they are leading their people and organizations into the unknown. In such conditions, tension naturally increases at the personal, team and organizational level.

With rising education and aspiration, most teams in organizations today are made up of people who are more vocal and who are not afraid to express their different and diverse views. Indeed, we want to attract people with such diverse talents and abilities into our teams.

Such diversity wil give rise to a higher level of tension in teams as members express their different perspectives and approaches to issues.
Often, leaders either avoid tension and conflict, or respond aggressively through control and power. This erodes trust in the team and leads to ineffective decision
making and poor quality outcomes and results, exacerbating the complexity and escalating the tension. A vicious cycle develops.


# Intentions for Workshop
* Build greater understanding and appreciation of tension as a source of learning and growth.
* Provide a framework and language to work with tension
* Identify options to respond to tension and use it for personal and team growth and development, and relationship building. These include:
    - Being aware of the stance we have towards tension and being able to switch to a more curious learner stance
    - Naming and framing tension in a more empowering way
    - Generating more empowering questions
    - Uncovering our values and framing tension as dilemmas
    - Advocating, inquiring and listening more deeply to hold more generative conversations which create more possibilities in tension


# Managing Tension - An Introduction
When we are caught in this vicious cycle, we often react, og ofr quick fixes, look for who or what we can blame, and conform to the status quo to stay within our comfort zone. This leads to a team culture of chronic anxiety.

Is there another way to navigate the tension such that it leads to more effective outcomes and a more generative energy and culture?
What fi we see tension as an opportunity for learning and growth - at the personal, team and organization level? What new conversations can we then hold that will harness the learning potential of tension, generate a higher quality of collective intelligence, deepen the community of trust and commitment, and strengthen our confidence to go into the unknown together?

# Tension
- Tension is a difference in perspectives, focus, gifting or awareness of what is happening and how to interpret it. It is needed for healthy and sustainable relationships.
-  Too much tension causes stress
-  Too little tension causes apathy, complacency
-  The key is to keep tension within a life-giving, generative and creative range - for ourselves and for team members
-  What is the life-giving range varies from one individual to another. One key role of a leader is to understand the diverse needs of team members with respect to tension and to work with them, and to model the communication that is required.

# Working with Tension
Managing tension as a leader involves building our capacity to lead in the midst of uncertainty. The goal is to be fully Present in my leadership, in the midst of the tension - not to flee from the tension, not to react to it. To be Fully Present means being able to
- Be fully engaged in the tension
- Minimize the anxiety I bring into the situation and
- Create a safe space for me and my team members to learn and grow from the situation.

Five core competencies are involved in building our capacity to manage tension effectively for growth and learning. What they are and how they are inter-related is captured in the diagram on the next page.

# Core Competencies for the Unknown
* Tension - A difference in relational opinion, focus, gifting or awareness of what is happening and how to interpret it. It is healthy, normal and needed.
* Inquiry -To have a voice, perspective and focus that matters. Because Iam limited and can't (and will never) know everything, I need to ask questions to get clarity. Questions are an expression of my commitment to the team and organization.
* Defend -The power to choose how I respond to tension in me. I have the authority to make my own choices and own them. tI is a healthy capacity I need to nurture and learn to work with. We have two basic options:
    * React - I don't think about it, but just have an automated reaction with little thought (react on impulse).
    * Reflective choice - After stepping back and reflecting, l act / respond in an appropriate way.

* Naming - The creative ability to use the power of words to choose how I will name, describe or frame a situation. The words I use create my 'map' of the world that I use to relate to others and live by.
* Values - Matters of the heart and the basis for the choices that I make. It is the basis for self-motivation. The language that values use to communicate is emotions. Where there is smoke, there is fire. Feelings is the "smoke" that leads us to Values ("fire").
All of this takes place within a relational 'system'. There are 5 levels in any relational system:
    * Personal
    * Interpersonal 
    * Team
    * Organisation
    * Whole System
    
Therefore, I must think holistically / systemically about the context of what is going on in others and the system we are all in.

# Role of Tension
Tension is a sign that there is life. Without tension there is:
- No Movement
- No Relationship
- No Life
Creating and managing tension is one of the leader's core roles


# Principles
* Work from the inside out 
    - Values / heart
* Growing people is our priority / Maturity
    - Org growth is fruit
* Relationship is a priority
* Life exposes us / it doesn't cause what is in us 
* Words are the most powerful tool we have to do this.
* Everything we see, hear, feel, runs through "filters"
* We create these filters or accept filters created by others

# Tension
* A sign of life
* Problem = Solvable, find the cause and fix it. 2+2=4
* Problem - Right answer - Predictable - Power - Control
* Dilemma = The paradox of two choices of equal value. Requires valuing others, serving them while maintaining your voice.
* Dilemma - Values - Unpredictable - Service - Relationship

* Power of the 'and'
* Tyranny of the 'or'
* Framing tension as a dilemma to be held rather than a problem to be solved
* Dilemma - what are the values that are in tension? How might we live into both values?
    - Focus: what is the most effective way?
* Problem to be solved - only one answer. Right or wrong
    - Focus: what is the right way?
* *Manager - solving problems. Leader - managing dilemmas


# Values - Feelings
* All of our choices are rooted in Value
* Intrinsic Value Obligates
    - Seeing a greater value creates a responsibility to choose it over something else of lesser value 
* Choice = Perceived Value
    - When the perceived value is clear, the choice is clear
* What will influence my choices?
    * Familiarity: when in doubt, we usually choose the familiar over the unfamiliar
    * Experiences
    * Authority
    * Culture
* The language that Values use is emotional (feelings)


# Feelings (Emotions)
Emotions serve as information to us. They are the 'smoke' that help us to uncover our values.
Here are our 5 basic emotions. How does each of these serve as information in relation to our values?
* Anger - when we feel blocked
* Joy - when we are successfully moving
* Disgust - when we feel violated
* Fear - when we experience fear
* Sadness - when we experience loss

* All emotions are information to our values. There are no negative emotions, only destructive emotions.

# Clarifying Values
Values: They are those heart expressions that motivate us, bring pleasure to us, give us energy and are a natural expression of who we are.
Core attributes of values are:
1. They are chosen freely.
2. They are chosen among alternatives.
3. They are chosen after careful consideration of the effects and
4. consequences of various alternatives.
5. They are acted upon.
6. They are repeated with consistency. They are prized and cherished.
7. They are publicly affirmed.

In order to be a full or primary value, each of the seven criteria must be met. If one or more criteria are missing, it becomes a value indicator.

# The Generative Power of Language
Words create and define relationships. Our ability to name something allows us to relate to it. The way we name it also defines the nature of our relationship to it.
In the same way, our inability to express or name the issue or situation we are experiencing disempowers us. We have no relationship to it and cannot invite others to share in our experience. If I don't know how to name something, I don't know how to relate to it.

The way we frame or express the issue profoundly impacts the way we see it, relate and respond to it. When I rename something, I create a new relationship with it.

Therefore the ability to name and frame the tension we are experiencing in an empowering way, is a critical capacity we need to build. Communication is our way of naming the world. Be conscious that the way we communicate or name any issue defines our relationship to it. It enables us to use tension more effectively as a source of learning and growth, and to generate life giving possibilities through the tension.

# Boundaries
"A boundary is a limit or space between you and the other person; a clear place where you begin, and the other person ends. The purpose of setting a healthy boundary is, of course, to protect and take good care of you while giving space for the other person to take care of themselves".

The assumption is that my life (body, mind and heart), has value and I have the authority/responsibility to watch over it and make decisions to take care of it. If I don't value it,
no one else will.
1. What do I need in a working relationship to keep strong and be healthy in the long term?
2. Where do I have a strong relationship? What are the boundaries that make it strong?
3. Where am I struggling with a relationship? What boundaries may be missing?
4. How clear are the boundaries in the case study where there is tension?

Healthy boundaries are a crucial component of self-care. That's because "in work or in our personal relationships, poor boundaries lead to resentment, anger, and burnout" (Nelson, 2016).

# Signs of Healthy Boundaries
1. I am fully present to the challenges of life.
2. I know who Iam and am not and have no shame in my limitations or needs.
3. I know my own gifting and use it when and where appropriate.
4. Tension is a seen as an opportunity to grow.
5. I can say 'no' without guilt.
6. I can ask for what I want or need.
7. I feel confident to ask questions when I don't know or need clarity.
8. I say what I mean and mean what I say.
9. I value myself and take care of myself.
10. I can say 'yes' because I want to, not because I feel an obligation to please others.
11. I have clear values and beliefs and live by them.
12. I feel safe and can express difficult emotions.
13. I am not afraid of challenging conversations and disagreements
14. I feel supported to pursue my own goals.
15. I treat myself as an equal.
16. I take responsibility for my own happiness.
17. I don't feel responsible for others happiness / or need to fix their sadness.
18. I am in tune with my own feelings, likes and preferences.
19. I can listen to others and identify with their pain, but not make it my own.

"Compassionate people ask for what they need. They say no when they need to. And when they say yes, they mean it. They're compassionate because their boundaries keep them out of resentment." - Brene Brown

"It's a dangerous thing to mistake speaking without thought for speaking the truth." - Detective Benoit Blanc

# Left-Hand Column*
The Left-Hand Column (LHC) is a tool that helps us be more aware of some of our internal responses to the external events and circumstances that impact us. It raises our awareness of the tacit assumptions(mental models) and feelings we hold which drive our actions and behaviours which, in turn, impact outcomes.

LHC can be used as a resource to raise our consciousness of these internal defensiveness and help us see how we often sabotage our best intentions. With this awareness, we can then make a choice to switch from a defensive and judgmental stance into a learner and curious stance. This switch to a learner/ curious stance opens up new possibilities and options for new actions and behaviours that can lead to new and more effective outcomes.

*The Left Hand Column is based on the two column research method developed by Chris Argyris and Donald Schon. It was presented in their book "Theory in Practice".

# Left Hand Column - An Example
Tension Issue:
I am behind in my project and my boss (Ms Lee) wants to review the project with me. This is a phone call.

| What the other party does or say | What I was thinking and feeling (Left Hand Column) | What we said (Right Hand Column) |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Ms Lee: / would like to set up a meeting to discuss the project. It's running behind. I think we might benefit from a review | We are only a couple of weeks late and she already press panic button - always so reactive! So frustrating! Aiyo -- where got time for meeting! Actually you are the problem -- always making changes. Just give me space to do the necessary and don't breathe down my neck! | We had some unexpected challenges, and we are trying to catch up by working round the clock. But if you think it necessary, we will make time for a meeting. |
| Ms Lee: Well, I thought we could have better coordination between us. There are some areas where I can also help. | Never give help during the planning stages when I really needed it. Now too little too late. You probably want to make more changes! If only I can tell her she is the major cause of the delays. If I can hold her off another week, I think we can be ready. | Oh I see. I would like to do up a prototype before we meet. Can we meet next week? |

# Competency of Inquiry: The Power of A Question
## The Power of A Question
* "An estimated forty percent of all questions that people utter are really statements in disguise. Another forty percent are really judgments in disguise: "Do you really think she deserved t raise?" Only a small percentage of "inquiries" are genuine questions." - William Isaacs
* "... the leader of the past may have been a person who knew how to tell, but the leader of the future will be a person who knows how to ask..." - Peter Drucker
* "If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask... for once / know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes." - Albert Einstein
* "The failure to ask questions . . . allows us to operate with a distorted sense of reality. In fact, Finkelstein calls companies that are unable to question their prevailing view of reality zombies. A zombie company, he says, is "a walking corpse that just doesn't yet know it's dead - because this company has created an insulated culture that systematically excludes any information that could contradict its reigning picture of reality". - Michael Marquardt
* "Leading from good to great does not mean coming up with answers and then motivating everyone to follow your messianic vision. It means having the humility to grasp the fact that you do not yet understand enough to have the answers and then to ask the questions that will lead to the best possible insights." - Jim Collins

# What Questions Do
* Create a focus
* Affect how we feel
* Are a part of taking ownership in something
* Summon help
* Change what we delete
    - Our minds can only hold so much information. The brain spends a lot of time trying to figure out what information is not needed.
* Empower us
* Why is ... taking advantage of me vs What can I learn from this situation?

# A-B-C-C Choice, Process & Questions
* Aware
    - Am I in Judger/ defensive mode?
    - What might be the symptoms and signs which indicate Iam moving into Judger/defensive mode?
* Breathe
    - Do I need to step back, pause, and look at this situation more objectively?
* Curiosity
    - Do I have all the facts?
    - What's happening here?
* Choose
    - What's my choice?
    - What matters most in this situation?


You may well ask: "Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?" You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Non violent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. 

It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the non violent-resister may sound rather shocking. But / must confess that I am not afraid of the word "tension." | have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, non violent tension which is necessary for growth. - Martin Luther King

# Teach me a Technique
Think of the difference between seduction and romance. Technique is required for the former but is useless in the latter. Being vulnerable, out of control, buffeted about by the experience, pained at any separation, aching for the next encounter, wild with jealousy, soaring with ecstasy, and plummeting with anxiety -all these are what make it a romance. If you know how to have a romance, it isn't a romance, but a seduction. Not knowing how to do it makes it a romance...

When we begin to understand how something works, we think immediately that we wil be able to make it work. That may be true in the physical world, but it is far from true in the world of human relations... In some fundamental sense, we cannot learn how to have relationships, how to raise children, how to lead others - how to be human, if you wil. 

Why? Because to be a great extent it is the very condition of not knowing, of being vulnerable to and surprised by life, of being unable to manage or control our lovers, our children, or our colleagues, that makes us human. - Richard Farson
