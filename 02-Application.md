# Applying Core Competencies in a Relational System

Leadership effectiveness in navigating the unknown is significantly enhanced by a deep understanding and application of five core competencies within the context of a relational system. These competencies—tension, inquiry, defense, naming, and values—are essential for fostering a culture of resilience, adaptability, and trust within teams and organizations.

## Tension as a Growth Catalyst

Recognizing **tension** as a healthy and necessary element of relational systems enables leaders to leverage differences in opinion, focus, and awareness to stimulate growth and innovation. Instead of viewing tension as a problem to be solved, leaders can see it as an opportunity to engage in meaningful dialogue and collaborative problem-solving.

## Inquiry for Clarity and Commitment

**Inquiry** is fundamental for leaders who acknowledge their limitations and the impossibility of knowing everything. By fostering an environment where asking questions is encouraged, leaders demonstrate their commitment to the team and organization. This openness to inquiry supports a culture of continuous learning and adaptation.

## Defense Strategies: React vs. Reflective Choice

Leaders and team members have the power to choose how they respond to tension. **Defense strategies** can manifest as immediate reactions or reflective choices. Cultivating the capacity for reflective choice rather than impulsive reactions allows for more thoughtful and effective responses to challenges.

## Naming to Frame Reality

The **naming** competency involves the creative use of language to frame situations. The words and narratives leaders choose shape the team's perception of reality and influence their responses to it. By consciously naming experiences and challenges, leaders can guide their teams towards constructive interpretations and actions.

## Values as the Basis for Choices and Motivation

Understanding and aligning with the **values** that drive individuals and teams are crucial for leadership. Values are the foundation of motivation and decision-making. Recognizing the emotional signals that indicate underlying values allows leaders to connect more deeply with their team members and guide them towards shared goals.

## Holistic Consideration of the Relational System

A relational system encompasses **personal, interpersonal, team, organizational, and whole system** levels. Effective leadership requires a systemic perspective, considering how dynamics at each level influence the overall system. This holistic approach enables leaders to address challenges comprehensively and leverage opportunities for growth across the system.

# Conclusion

Integrating these core competencies within a systems thinking framework empowers leaders to navigate the complexities and uncertainties of their environments more effectively. By embracing tension, fostering inquiry, making reflective choices, thoughtfully naming situations, and aligning with shared values, leaders can enhance team dynamics and drive organizational success in the face of the unknown.
